# Door_locker_RFID_KEYPAD
# Door Locker using RFID and Keypad üîê

This is a simple door lock system I made using:
- RFID card reader
- Keypad (to enter password)
- Arduino Uno
- Servo motor (to lock/unlock the door)
- Wires

---

## How it works:
- You can unlock the door by **scanning your RFID card**  
- Or by **entering a correct PIN on the keypad**
- If it's correct, the **servo motor unlocks the door**

---

## Things I used:
- Arduino Uno  
- RFID Module (RC522)  
- 4x4 Keypad  
- Servo motor  
- Jumper wires  

---

## How to use:
1. Open the code in Arduino IDE  
2. Upload it to Arduino Uno  
3. Connect all components  
4. Try scanning the card or entering the PIN
